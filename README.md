# Indorse Connections Feature #

This is the code for the smart contract to be used for the [Indorse](https://indorse.io) connections feature. 

The contract code is in './contracts' and the testing suite exists in './test'.

For testing the code we recommend the use of [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) for which basic configuration files are provided.

## Testing

1. [Install Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/installation)

```npm install -g truffle```

2. Intall all package dependencies:

```npm install```

3. EITHER run the test suite using the truffle console:

```truffle develop```

```truffle(develop)>test```

4. OR run truffle test suite directly by starting '[ganache](http://truffleframework.com/docs/ganache/using)' tool and then:

```truffle test```
